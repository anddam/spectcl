By selecting the column handle (click on it - it will turn
<color value=red>red</color>) we can click again to toggle its
resize behavior, making it a resizable column. Notice the ends of the
column indicator have changed to arrow heads.
<p>
Since we have already configured the frame to fill its entire cavity, 
the second column, now resizable, fills up the previously unoccupied
space in the cavity.
<p>
Notice that the columns on the first row are disjoint from those
on the second row.

KAC 9 Aug 96
* Changed grid lines to be selectable, and then the insert key inserts
  columns and/or rows.
* Delete works on grid lines.
* the geom: array is gone, along with the table_setup function.
* arrows are now real-time.
* grid lines can be drug to widen/shrink the grid.
* grid sweeps cannot be done below 0, as grid doesn't handle that.
* grid2 reports slaves in a different order than grid1, so the 
  code has to be order independent.
* made sure that the code works a well using wish4.1 as wish4.2.
* dialog boxes for location were replaced using Ioi lam's dialog boxes.
* sweeping of outlines happens more intuitively.
* The separate fill/anchor widgets have been replaced with a single
  'sticky' widget.
* changed the scrollbars to look "normal", so they don't depress as you move 
  the cursor over them.
* made a preferences dialog, and moved the preferences over there.
* provided a mechanism to put "fake" widgets in the toolbar, as a precursor
  to having composite widgets, and java mega-widgets.
* provided balloon-help for menu items.
* provied for early quitting of the about box, (though maybe the "early"
  stuff should just slam all the widgets in place so that people can shortcut
  to the end...?)
* The kill test menu didn't work as advertised in menubar.menu, the code
  had been manually changed in menubar.menu.tcl.  Updated mainmenu.tk
  to reflect the change.
* changed the widget search mechnism to be more robust.
********************************************************************
* KAC - Changed java_setup.tk to bind {} to the <Return> event for
  the .entry so that widgets don't get multi-line labels.
* KAC - Changed button highlighting when dragging so that there's 
  red border around the button when depressed.
* KAC - Changed the relief of the preferences.
* KAC - Changed the expr's in grid and save.tk so they now work
  under the compiler.
* KAC - Set the toolbar up so that it also tracks the state of the
  template widgets represented by the palette.
* KAC - Make the column/row geometry propagate down when rows/columns
        are deleted.
* KAC - Put evalstats in the list of commands not to try...(it's a 
        compiler procedure.
* KAC - Put a "get rid of" button on the Java tk_dialog box.
* KAC - Changed SpecTcl to remember what the initial size is, and
        save that as its minimum size.
* KAC - Color lists are now saved with projects.  Projects that don't
        have color lists get the last one made.
* KAC - Improved handling of wierdness passed in via the -path blah option.
* KAC - Fixed menus so that when a palette item is selected, ^-W does
        the option sheet thing.
* KAC - Changed options so that there's a concept of a 'global' option,
        so that if you're changing the 'variable' option on one widget,
        and pull the option sheet up on another widget, it'll be on
        the 'variable' entry.  If that fails, it looks at the last
        focused item for this type of widget.
* KAC - Changed option sheets so that when the scrollbar is released,
        the topmost item is focused so that when the mouse is moved 
        outside the toplevel, and back in forms_focus_in doesn't 
        move you to another part of the form.
* KAC - Fixed sync_relief so that it's correct again.
* KAC - Added combo boxes to many of the items in an option sheet.
* KAC - Added several short cut keys, changed arrow key movement
* KAC - Fixed changing the font style on a widget changes it's bg.
* KAC - Fixed a bug with Load project into a frame.
* KAC - Fixed a bug where moving between widgets using the keyboard
        accelerators now does a sync_all
* KAC - when going between widgets with the pineed option sheets
        the last property selected will now show up.
* KAC - Fixed a bug with orientation introduced when double-clicking
        the palette was introduced.
* KAC - Made sure that Delete and Insert didn't get through the option
        sheet
* KAC - Used Base_dir to find images.
* KAC - Fixed a bug where the faux widgets made when comboboxes were
        created weren't being destroyed.
---------------putback 9-12-96------------------------------------
* KAC - Fixed file name on the command line to work again with
        $P(project_dir)
* KAC - Fixed bug where if choosing a color for the preferences, and
        'cancel' chosen, the interface was broken after that.
* KAC - Fixed MacScrollbars to work.
* KAC - Bound cut/copy/paste to virtual events.
* KAC - Set preferences to only auto-raise when creating.

* KAC - Fixed toggling of palette items so that if a palette
        item is selected, clicking it again turns it off.
* KAC - Bound <Escape> on . to unselect_all.
* KAC - Fixed a bug whereby gridline sweeping didn't update the correct
        arrowheads.
* KAC - When in click-to-insert mode, and a widget is clicked, the 
        new widget is selected.  (but you stay in click to insert mode...
        is this a problem?)
* KAC - Fixed the bug that happened when you added the same color twice
* KAC - Ugh...combobox bindings were complex.  Fixed a bug where you
        couldn't use the scrollbar to scan down the listbox.
* KAC - Added a default button to the bottom of option sheets.
* KAC - Fixed how the project_dir was being prepended on the filename at save time.
-----------------------------putback 9-13-96---------------------------
* KAC - Fixed a bug that caused filenames with hyphens in them to fail.
* KAC - Fixed the problem where focus wasn't being set back to the entry
        widget after widget_end_sweep
* KAC - Fixed a focus bug that made the sticky option sheets hard to use.
* KAC - updated the preferences dialog.
* SAH - Fixed help to run on Macs.
* KAC - Fixed the bug where the 'revert' button brought up the message 
        'dummy already exists'.
* KAC - The relief wasn't setting it's reapply command properly causing
        a crash.
* KAC - Fixed a bug where subframes changed the dragging bindings, 
        causing grid_sweep to crash if the last sub-frame instantiated 
        was deleted.
* KAC - Fixed a bug where if the user resized a cell to be smaller than
        the largest widget, and then dragged a gridline, the dragging
	was off by the difference.
* KAC - Added the ctrl-. binding again.  Geez.
* KAC - Fixed a bug where the grid size wasn't applied to both rows and
        columns.
* KAC - In file selector box, set the default pathname to [pwd] 
        instead of {.}.  This gets around (sorta) a bug in the file
        dialogs where if given the leading path of '.', the file dialog
        repeats it.
* KAC - Fixed a bug where a copied widget got the same row/col span that
        the original did.
* KAC - Fixed a bug where the last grid line in a subframe was selected 
        and the user pressed 'delete'.  This caused subtle problems with
        the internal data structures.  Removed.
* KAC - Removed the common file dialogs form the source directory, so
        that the users *must* have wish4.2b1 or later to run.
* KAC - Fixed a spurious bug where 'Save_grid_color' wasn't set yet, but
        the user got a Leave event on a grid, which caused a crash.
* KAC - Minimum size of the main sheet is handled much better now.
* KAC - Fixed a bug where help wasn't seen on the Mac.
----------------------------------------------------------------

        of ctrl-e (edit code) and ctrl-a (save as...)
* KAC - Fixed a bug where pulling up the option sheet with a ctrl-w
        caused the entry widget to be erased.
* KAC - Added an extra ')' to the help that's displayed via balloonhelp.
* KAC - Added protection to frames so that they can't stick to opposite
        sides of an enclosing cell without one row/column being 
        resizeable.
* KAC - Fixed a bug in code that was written in 'edit code', in that
        the carriage returns where being eaten, and that messed things
        up.
* KAC - Fixed a bug in 'Save As', where the name of the Current(project)
        wasn't being set, so it would try to overwrite the old .tcl file.
* KAC - Made SpecTcl and SpecJava have two different preferences files 
        because they were just too different to fix.
* KAC - Added updating information when dragging a gridline
* KAC - Set the windows up so that they all iconify and open as a group
        using the bind_map and bind_unmap functions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* KAC - Fixed the extra cells not getting chopped off as necessary when
        a small interface was put in a large grid.
* KAC - Got rid of pre-setting the directory.

        names so that SpecTcl works on CDE systems.
* KAC - Fixed overrideredirect characteristics of the comboboxes
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------Beta1-----------------------------------------------
* KAC - Fixed font and color problems with CDE.
* KAC - Fixed resize bug that happened upon insertion/deletion.
* KAC - Fixed bug that was caused by font not being provided by CDE.
        Didn't add post command because figuring out if the 4 types 
        of styles exist for a given face at given size would take a
        long time, and make the interface slower.
* KAC - Fixed font options for single style fonts (eg 7x14)
* KAC - rewrote option sheets for speed.
* KAC - allowed external editors
* KAC - rewrote saving functions to get around foreach/split compiler
        bug

        dependant stuff into port.tk
* KAC - Allowed double-clicking on a UI document on the Mac to start
        up SpecTcl.
* KAC - Made the Mac change the font type/creator, so that UI files
        are owned by SpecTcl, .tcl files are owned by wish.

	were supposed to.

--------- patchlevel 1
* KAC - Attempt to fix the weight bug.

        are accessible by catching a bogus loading of tk_optionMenu.
        If that doesn't work, we bail.
--------- patchlevel 6 (unix only release, though it won't hurt on windows
        or mac machines.)
* KAC - *sigh* Changed the version check so that it fails for versions < 4.1
        mostly because we don't want to maintain the common dialogs for 4.1.
        Got rid of the files clrpick.tcl comdlg.tcl  msgbox.tcl  tkfbox.tcl 
--------- patchlevel 7 (unix only release)
* KAC - a couple of directional gifs were missing in SpecTcl sew and nse.
--------- patchlevel 8 (all platform release)
* KAC - On windows, if the registry worked, but the registry entry 
        was bad, SpecTcl couldn't handle it.
--------- patchlevel 9 (windows only release)
* KAC - Shucks. the Registry.dll file caused too many troubles and crashes.
        Found an alternative way.  Not as slick, but it'll work for now.

* KAC - Fixed combo boxes so that they trigger on button release over
        the listbox.
* KAC - Fixed a really gross bug where when pushed the 'additional options' 
        button brought up the wrong option sheet.
--------- patchlevel 11
* KAC - Left a debugging statement in for the combobox pulldowns.  *sigh*
* KAC - Fixed a recursion problem with delete_selected where frames wouldn't
        delete their children.  Nasty.

* KAC - Fixed a bug where the numbers in some comboboxes on the option
        sheets weren't sorted in numerical order.
* KAC - Fixed the bug that allowed people to try to save projects
        as 'foo.ui.tcl', confusing the heck out of Spectcl.
* KAC - Fixed the bug where editted code stays in the text widget after
        the interface has a 'new' done on it.

* KAC - Took another shot at "fixing" the html rendering problem when a
        window is destroyed.
* KAC - Set the help message for the java helpfiles to point to http://www.javasoft.com:80/products/jdk/1.1/docs/api/packages.html

        things were being passed to routines that expected only widgets.

END -- formerly in SpecTcl/changes

---------------------- Release 1.0, 1/14/97 -------------------------

5/14/97 (bug fix) "File->Save" menu asked for "file exists,
overwrite?" confirmation while it shouldn't (IL).

5/14/97 (bug fix) "File->Save As" menu asked for "file exists,
overwrite?" confirmation twice (IL).

5/14/97 (bug fix) "File->Save As" menu asked for "file exists,
overwrite?" confirmation twice (IL).

5/15/97 (misfeature correction) The handling of WM_DELETE_WINDOW
event. If there is unsaved changes, the user can choose "Cancel",
which will cancel the close window action. This is consistent with
Windows/Motif GUI standards. (IL)

5/15/97 (bug fix) Fixed bug where hitting the delete key inside an
entry will kill the currently selected widget (IL).

5/16/97 (new feature) New command line switch -html to generate output
in HTML-form format (IL).

5/21/97 (misfeature correction) Changed "File" menu commands (New,
Open, Save, Save As, Quit) and "Build" and "Build and Test" commands
so that they adhere to common design rules on Windows and Mac. The
behavior of the commands under the "File" menu should be exactly the
same as the Windows Notepad program. (IL)

5/21/97 (new feature) New initialization file startup.tcl that catches
initialization errors and reports them to the user. Use this file,
instead of main.tk, to start up SpecTcl. (IL)

5/22/97 (new feature) The "Build and Test" command no longer
recompiles the .tcl file if there has been no changes in the UI since
the last time the test was run. (IL)

5/22/97 (bug fix) Fixed bug where menubar_getmenuname didn't work
under native menus on Tk 8.0. (IL)

6/9/97 (new feature) A backup file <name>.ui.bak is always saved when
the .ui file is about to be written into. (IL)

6/9/97 (misfeature correction) When a widget is selected, the user
must click on the "Label:" entry in order to edit the label of this
widget. This simplifies the event handling in SpecTcl. E.g., the
meaning of the <Delete> key is now well-defined. (IL)

6/18/97 (misfeature correction) The "Label:" entry in the toolbar is
renamed to "Text:" to better indicate that this applies to the -text
option of widgets. The "Edit Label" menu command is also changed to
"Edit Widget Text". (IL)

6/18/97 (feature change) The bug reporting dialog has been removed
because SpecTcl is no longer a supported product. (IL)

6/18/97 (new feature) Popup menu added to the widget palette for
choosing auto-drop mode and generic options. (IL)

6/18/97 (feature change) Generic options has been moved into a cascade
menu with entries corresponding to the generic options of each widget
type. (IL)

6/18/97 (misfeature correction) Names of menu items are changed
so that each important word (i.e., except prepositions) is
capitalized. (IL)

9/17/97 (bug fix) Added checking code to avoid undefined variable
errors or unknown window errors, in the following files: button.tk,
forms.tk, grid.tk, java_setup.tk, jdk11_setup.tk, subs.tk, and
toolbar.tk.

9/17/97 (misfeature correction) If you selected a color after choosing
the "more .." button in the color menu, the color wouldn't be
propagated to the widget.

9/17/97 (bug fix) The proc "OutFilter_font" in filters.tk would dump
stack if given "bad" font size, e.g.. like "fixed,08"; or if there were
space chars inside the font name like "fixed, 8 , bold"

9/17/97 (bug fix) "auto save on exit" option in the pref dialog had no
effect

9/17/97 (bug fix) confirm save on compile" option in the pref dialog
had no effect

9/17/97 (bug fix) "sticky" and some other options sometimes did not
show on properties dialog.

9/22/97 (feature change) Changed license for SpecTcl and SpecTcl
source to be free. See the file license.terms.  (RJ)

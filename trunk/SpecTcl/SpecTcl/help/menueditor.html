<h1>
The Menueditor</h1>
The menueditor is opened by selecting "Edit" in the main menubar and hereafter
selecting the "Edit Menus..." item. It is still under development, so you
might like to see the list of <a href="bugs.html">known bugs and shortcomings</a>.
<p>The left part of the window is for managing the menus as a whole, while
the right side is for managing the individual items in each menu.
<p>A demo of the menu is shown in the top left corner of your screen. Do
not click on this menu as it is only for visual demonstration. Use the
arrow keys in the menueditor window to select different items in the menu.
<h2>
Managing Menus</h2>
The left part of the window is for managing the menus as whole entities.
The listbox shows the widget names of all existing menus. The one selected
here will be shown in the top left hand corner of the screen and can be
editted in the right hand side of the menu editor window. It is up to the
user to name the menus so that they comply with correct Tcl/Tk syntax.
The file <b>demos/newmenudemo.ui</b> is a good example of how to do this.
<ul>
<li>
New menus are added with the <i>New</i> button</li>

<li>
Edit the name of a menu with the <i>Rename</i> button</li>

<li>
Delete a menu with the <i>Remove</i> button</li>

<li>
If for some reason the demo menu gets hidden, it can be redisplayed with
the <i>View/Post</i> button</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Managing Items</h2>
The right part of the menueditor window shows the available properties
for the selected item in the selected menu. These can be changed by editing
the values and pressing the <i>Update</i> button or the <i>Return</i> key
on your keyboard. the type should always be set first as it resets all
the other values. Other things that one can do are:
<ul>
<li>
Add a new menu-item to the end of the menu with the <i>Add</i> button or
by pressing the down arrow key when the last item is selected.</li>

<li>
Insert a new menu-item just before the selected item by pressing the <i>Insert</i>
button or the <i>Insert</i> button on your keyboard.</li>

<li>
Select another item by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.</li>

<li>
Delete an item by pressing the <i>Delete</i> button. When the focus is
not in an entry, the <i>Delete</i> button on the keyboard also does this.</li>
</ul>

<li>
This is a list of known bugs, limitations, glitches, gotchas, wishes, and
fumbles. It shows basically what our thinking currently is on what SpecTcl
needs to become a more mature interface. To add to this list, please send
email to spectcl@tcl.eng.sun.com with your comment or suggestion.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Up arrows don't do anything when gridline selected.</li>

<li>
^-K needs to have bindings in the test app window.</li>

<li>
Toolbars don't update forms when sample buttons' option sheets are shown.</li>

<li>
The text entry widget should get smarter...it should represent many things.</li>

<li>
Clicking on the toolbar buttons with custom menus doesn't work quite like
menus.</li>

<li>
Stipled icons don't work on some platforms.</li>

<li>
Attach scrollbars is very vague, and not informative.</li>

<li>
When Option sheet is up, and user focuses on main window and hits delete
to delete the widget, the option sheet should go away/grey out.</li>

<li>
No insert key on Mac keyboard...Argh!</li>

<li>
Option sheets open too wide originally on Macs.</li>

<li>

<li>

<li>

</ul>
I can think of the following for the menu-editor:
<ul>
<li>
Selecting items needs to be faster</li>

<li>
Selecting items with the mouse</li>

<li>
Better support for cascades</li>

<li>
Show menubars as menubars</li>

<li>
Copy menus and individual items</li>

<li>
Checks on item properties and menu names</li>

<li>
Editting widget properties of menus</li>

<li>
Warn about unsaved changes when only menus have been editted</li>

<li>
Strange active behaviour after inserting an item (this may be a Tk bug)</li>

<li>
Separators are not shown as active (not possible in Tk)</li>
</ul>

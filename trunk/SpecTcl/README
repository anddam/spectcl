Welcome to release 1.1 of SpecTcl/SpecJava

This is a source release of Spectcl 1.1.  This will run as provided
under Windows 95, MacOS, various UNIX flavors, with Tcl 7.6 and Tk
4.2 or greater.

Under UNIX, if this distribution is unpacked into $SPECHOME, then the
DIR variable in the scripts "specJava" and "specTcl" in the bin
subdirectory of $SPECHOME need to be editted to point the
$SPECHOME. See comments in these two scripts for details.

Under Windows the installer puts an entry in the Startup menu for
SpecTcl.

Under Macintosh you simply need to run the provided installer.

See license.terms for the SpecTcl licensing terms.

See the file: "changes" for a list of changes made since the previous
release.

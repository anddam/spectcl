Tk and <color value=red>java</color> use different names for, well, just about everything.  In many cases, the Tk names
are used.  This section maps the Tk names into their <color value=red>java</color> equivalents.

<h2><a name=R2 href=#top><color value=red>Java</color> specific component options</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt>Checkbox (radiobutton) Groups
<dd>In <color value=red>java</color>, check-boxes are turned into radio-buttons by associating a check-box
group to them.  In SpecJava, the <code>variable</code> option on the property
sheet for radio buttons controls which group the button belongs to.
The easyest way to make a group of radio buttons is to create the first one,
set its <code>variable</code>, and then copy it using <em>shift-drag</em>.
<dt>Choice (menubutton) widgets
<dd>The choices are input as a comma-separated list in the
<code>items</code> option.  The label (<code>text</code> option) also appears
as a choice if specified.
</dl>
<p>
Several options on the component property sheets have special meaning to <color value=red>java</color>.
They are:
<dl>
<dt>action
<dd>A valid <color value=red>java</color> statement should be entered here.  Typically this is a method invocation, either
from a method inherited in the current class, a static method, such as <code>System.out.println()</code>,
or a method of the <code>arg</code> instance variable, such as <code>arg.foo()</code>.
The local variable <code>event</code> of type <code>Event</code> is available as an argument, as
are all of the user interface objects.
<dt>item_name
<dd>
This is used as the name of the <color value=red>java</color> instance for this user interface element.
If the default value is used, the "#" is changed into a "_".
This name will also be a public instance variable in the generated <color value=red>java</color> code.
<dt>subclass
<dd>
This option is used to specify an alternate class for this user interface element.  <code>Subclass</code>
should be a subclass of the component used.  Subclassing to change the behavior by overriding the
<code>action</code> method will not work, the <b>action</b> option should be used instead.
If the <code>subclass</code> option is of the form:
<ul>
<code>subclass.method(args)</code>
</ul>
then right after the object is created (of type <code>subclass</code>), the <code>method</code> method is called with
the arguments indicated, permitting subclass specific initialization to occur.
<dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name=R1 href=#top>Accessing the <color value=red>Java</color> additions to the <b>SpecTcl</b> user interface</a></h2>
<p>
These <color value=red>java</color> specific functions have been added to the
menus:
<dl>
<dt> java
<dd> on the <b>command</b> menu, takes <color value=red>java</color> code (in <code><subst>$Current(project).java</subst></code>)
generated from the saved user interface specification, currently
<code><subst>$Current(project).jui</subst></code>,
compiles it (with javac) and runs the interface in test mode.
If the file <code><subst>$Current(project).html</subst></code> exists in the
current directory, the user interface will be tested by calling the applet viewer.
Otherwise, it will be run as a standalone application.
<p>
The name of the user interface, as indicated on the title bar
(e.g. <code><subst>$Current(project)</code></subst>),
is used as the name of the class.
<dt> kill java
<dd> on the <b>command</b> menu, terminates the current test application,
if one is running.  This only works on systems that support the <em>kill</em> command.
<dt> java...
<dd> on the preferences menu, pops up a dialog box to specify the <color value=red>java</color> code
generation options of SpecTcl.  These are used to control how the user
interface is integrated into the rest of the
<color value=red>java</color> application (or applet).
The preferences contain the following items:
<dl>
<dt>package <x>(currently "<subst>$P(package)</subst>")
<dd>The name of the <color value=red>java</color> package this class will belong to.  The default is the empty package.
<dt>imports <x>(currently "<subst>$P(imports)</subst>")
<dd>The name of a package to import.  This is mostly used when there is a
<code><subst>$Current(project).include.java</subst></code> file in use.
<dt>extends <x>(currently "<subst>$P(extends)</subst>")
<dd>The name of the class that this class will inherit from.
<dt>implements <x>(currently "<subst>$P(implements)</subst>")
<dd>The name of the interface that the class will implement.  This is useful when several
different use interface panels need to be used from the same application.
<dt>arg type <x>(currently "<subst>$P(arg)</subst>")
<dd>Each generated class contains a public instance variable called <code>arg</code>.  This
may be used as a reference to invoke methods from in the <i>action</i> fields of the user interface
elements.  The type of this variable is defined here.  If you choose not to use it, or leave
it blank, <code>Object</code> is used for the type.
</dl>
<dt>java api
<dd> on the help menu, allows access to the current <color value=red>java</color> documentation.  If
this menu item is missing, then SpecJava was not installed properly, so
the documentation could not be found.  The current location is thought to be
<subst>$doc_dir</subst>.
<dt>java notes
<dd>This page, from the help menu.
</dl>
<h2><a name=R3 href=#top>Generated code</a></h2>
<p>
The class generated by SpecTcl
(e.g. <code><subst>$Current(project)</subst></code>)
consists of the following public methods:
<dl>
<dt>public Object[] getWidgets()
<dd>This array contains the user interface element objects and checkbox groups.
<dt>public String[] getNames()
<dd>This array contains the string names of the interface elements, as indicated on the <code>item_name
</code> option of the property sheet.  The order corresponds to the ordering in the
<code>getWidgets</code> method.
<dt>public void init()
<dd>
This method instantiates the user interface.  It will be called automatically if the class is
run from a browser or applet viewer.  The <code>super.init</code> method is called to allow
application specific initialization to occur.
<dt>public boolean handleEvent(Event event)
<dd>All of the behavior, as entered in the <code>action</code> property is dispatched from this
method, which is overridden from the component class.  For every event for which no action is defined,
the <code>super.handleEvent</code> method is called, allowing for generic behaviors to be
handled by the parent class.
<dt>public static void main(String[] args)
<dd>
This calls the <code>init</code> method, permitting the class to be run as a standalone
application.
</dl>
<h4>Instance variables and application specifics.</h4>
<ul>
<li src=aqball.gif align=baseline>
Each of the user interface components is defined to be a public instance
variable, and therefore accessible from within the <code>action</code> property.
<li src=aqball.gif align=baseline>
The variable <code>arg</code> is an application specific slot, whose type is determined from
the <code>arg type</code> option of the property sheet, to make it easy to invoke methods
from unrelated classes in the <code>action</code>property.
</ul>
<h2><a name=R5 href=#top>Miscellaneous</a></h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li src=aqball.gif align=baseline>
If the file <code><subst>$Current(project).include.java</subst></code> exists in the
current directory, then the code is inserted directly into the generated <color value=red>java</color> code.
This technique, however, is discouraged.
<li src=aqball.gif align=baseline>
Application specific functionality may be added to <em>SpecTcl</em> by including <em>Tcl</em>
commands in the file <code><subst>$Current(project).rc</subst></code>.
<li src=aqball.gif align=baseline>
Arbitrary strings may be associated with particular widgets, by adding new options to the
widget property sheet, and making them available in the generated code as an array of strings,
one per widget.
<p>
As an example, suppose automated entry field validation is desired.  An new property, 
called <code>check</code> can be added to every entry widget by placing the following code
in the file <code><subst>$Current(project).rc</subst></code> file in the current directory.
<ul>
set P(other_items:entry) check.
</ul>
Then that property can be exported into the generated code with the line:
<ul>
set P(export) "check"
</ul>
where the value can be a list of exported properties.  The generated code will have a public
method called
<code>check</code> which returns the array of strings containing the <code>check</code> option
for every widget.  The order of the strings is the same as returned by the
<code>getNames</code> method of the generated class.
</ul>

This demo demonstrates the use of custom components from SpecJava.  In
this case, any java "applet" may be embedded as a component (thanks to
Cris Perdue).
The new component is created by dragging a <em>canvas</em> into the
desired location, then using the <em>sub-class</em> field on the option
sheet to specify its class, and initialization method (if any).

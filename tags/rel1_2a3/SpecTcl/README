Welcome to release 1.2 of SpecTcl/SpecJava

This is a source release of Spectcl 1.2.  This will run as provided
under Windows 95, MacOS, various UNIX flavors, with Tcl/Tk 8.0 or
greater.

Under UNIX, if this distribution is unpacked into $SPECHOME, then the
DIR variable in the scripts "specJava" and "specTcl" in the bin
subdirectory of $SPECHOME need to be editted to point the
$SPECHOME. See comments in these two scripts for details.

Under Windows, use bin/specTcl.bat 

Under Macintosh it should hopefully be simple as well.

See license.terms for the SpecTcl licensing terms.

See the file: "changes" for a list of changes made since the previous
release.

# Each "paragraph" describes an example application
# most of which are explained in detail in the
# SpecTcl User's Guide. Some are interesting in 
# themselves; others are only meant to complement
# the explanation in the gude.

# After you build the exAssemS.ui assembly, you should
# run it's partner: exAssemM.ui. The exAssemM.ui
# example loads exAssemS.ui twice to show the
# widget name qualification that enables this to
# work.

# The exAssemM.ui example demonstrates how you
# can develop some interfaces as subassemblies
# and then load them at run-time into frames. 
# First you must do a build of exAssemS.ui so you
# have the Tcl file exAssemS.ui.tcl. Then run 
# build and run exAssemM.ui.
# The main point is that the scale assembly
# exAssemS.ui.tcl is loaded twice. To see the name
# qualification that makes this work, look at
# the code generated for exAssemM.ui.tcl. And 
# note how the statements below load exAssemS_ui 
# into frames.


# The exButton.ui example demonstrates that a button
# can display an image file instead of text.

# The exCheckbutton.ui example demonstrates the
# way a script determines which checkbutton was clicked.

# The exEntry.ui example shows how to bind an
# individual entry widget to a Key-Return event
# and how to use a bindtag (Entry) that bind
# all entry widgets to a Key-Return event.

# The exFrame.ui example is used to show how to
# select the frame and elements within the frame.
# It also demonstrates how the frame can pass on
# application-window space to its children, and how
# this is under your control as design time.

# The exHello.ui example shows how to call a proc from 
# a button's command property

# The exLabel1.ui example shows a label displaying text 
# to identify another widget

# The exLabel2.ui example toggles between showing a
# long and short strings to show how the interface
# adjusts.

# The exListbox.ui example demonstrates the working
# of a listbox. After, displaying four items in the
# listbox, the script displays text and an image when
# any of the listbox items is clicked.

# The exLong1.ui example shows:
# -- How to capture text from an entry widget 
#    when the user presses the Return key.
# -- How to use the Button command property to 
#    call a proc.
#

# The exMenubutton.ui example shows how a script
# builds menus and how menubuttons communicate with
# the script.

# The exMessage.ui example demos the message widget. 
# When you enter a long string of text in the entry widget
# and press the Return key, the message widget adds
# newline characters and displays the message. When you 
# click on a button, you change the aspect property of 
# the message widget.

# The exRadiobutton.ui example shows the way
# a script can determine which radiobutton 
# was "pushed".

# The exRadiobutton2.ui example demonstrates the way
# labels can resize themselves to accommodate the text
# or image that they are currently displaying

# The exRelief.ui example demonstrates each of the options
# for the relief property: plain, raised, sunken,
# ridge, and groove.

# The exResize.ui example shows the affect of
# setting resizeability on and off for rows and
# columns. After building and running this application,
# resize the application window and notice which
# widget change size and which stay the same.

# The exScale.ui example shows the following:
# -- That moving the scale changes the value.
# -- That changing the value (by clicking on the
#    +5 or -5 buttons) causes the scale to move.
# -- That when you tie the scale value to a widget
#    (the width of the "resizable" label), that 
#    a width of 0 (which means "resize yourself" is
#    actually wider than, say a width of 5.

# The exScrollbar.ui example show how the scrollbar
# widget interacts with the text widget.

# The exSize1.ui example has a default sticky property 
# so that the widgets are self-sized. Contrast this with
# exSize2.ui.

# The exSize2.ui example has a sticky property of ew
# so that the widgets are aligned. Contrast this with
# exSize1.ui.

# The exSticky.ui example shows the various positions
# a widget takes in its grid cell with different
# sticky properties

# The exText.ui example shows how the text and
# scrollbar widgets work and interact.

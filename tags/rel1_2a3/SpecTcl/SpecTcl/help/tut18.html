<p>
We can tab to the <em>bitmap</em> item of the option sheet, and fill
out the desired bitmap name. You can type it, or select one of the
options given in the combo box. If you select something from the combobox,
the change is immediately sent to the widget. While we are typing,
the text is displayed in <color value=red>red</color> to indicate the
bitmap name has not yet been validated. To validate the item, key either
<code>return</code> or <code>tab</code>. As soon as the item is validated,
the widget is configured to reflect the new value.  The 'Dismiss' button
gets rid of the option sheet. The 'Revert' button returns the widget
to the state it was in when the option sheet was opened up. If the
widget that this property sheet is for is a regular widget, the 'Default'
button set this field to be the value of the template's field. If the
option sheet is for a palette widget, the 'Default' button sets the
field to be the default for the platform.

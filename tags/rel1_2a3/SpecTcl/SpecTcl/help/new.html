<title>SpecTcl New and experimental features</title>
<h1>Java support</h1>
This version of SpecTcl has an experimental <em>java</em> code generator
available.
<h2>Turning on the Java Support</h2>
Java support can be added to SpecTcl by adding the line
<pre>
		source $Base_dir/java_setup.tk
</pre>
to the file <code>SpecTclrc</code> in your home directory.
Make sure that the java compiler (javac) and interpreter (java) are in your
execution path.
<h2>Using the Java support</h2>
The Java support adds two additional commands to the <strong>edit</strong>
menu:
<DL>
<dt>Java
<dd>Causes a java file to be generated, compiled, and tested.
<dt>Kill java
<dd>Kills any existing java test
</dl>
In addition, the file <strong>java.project</strong>
in the current directory is sourced when the java support is first loaded,
and may be used to add project specific behavior to the generated java code
as explained below.
<h2>The Java code generator</h2>
The Java code generator defines a new class, whose name is the same as
the SpecTcl project name.
By default, the class extends <strong>java.applet.Applet</strong>, and
is placed in the default package.  The class contains the following items:
<ul>
<li src=aqball.gif align=baseline>New methods defined
<dl>
<dt>public static void main(String[] args)
<dd>A default <em>main</em> for testing, starts the interface in a toplevel.
<dt>public String[] getNames()
<dd>Returns an array of the widget and radiobutton-group names.
<dt>public Object[] getWidgets()
<dd>Returns an array of widget and radio-button-group objects, in the same
order as <code>getNames</code>.
</dl>
<li src=aqball.gif align=baseline>Methods that are overridden from a super class
<dl>
<dt>public void init()
<dd>This instantiates the user interface.  It is called directly if the
application is run stand-alone, and implicitly when run an as applet.
The super-class <code>init</code> routine is also called after the interface
is instantiated, to permit application specific initialization to occur.
<dt>public boolean handleEvent(Event event)
<dd>Any actions associated with the widgets (as specified with the "action"
option of the widget) are dispatched via the <code>handle_event</code>
method.
Actions that are not explicitly set with the <em>action</em> option
are handled by the super class.
Eventually an interface to bindings will be provided to allow events
other than "action" events.
</dl>
<li src=aqball.gif align=baseline>Public instance variables
All of the widgets and radiobutton-groups, as returned by the
<code>getWidgets</code> method are public instance variables.
</ul>
<h2>Interfacing to application code</h2>
Application specific code 
is specified by using the <em>action</em>
option for each widget.  The actions are java statements to be invoked
when the action occurs.  Normally the statement is expected to be a Java
method call.  The local variable <strong>event</strong> of class <strong>
Event</strong> is available to pass to the method as an argument. The
event class contains both a handle to the widget and to the event that
is being performed.
<p>
The file <strong>java.project</strong> in the current directory contains
TCL code to tailor the code generator for a specific application.  The
following sample is illustrative:
form:
<pre>
	set P(extends) my_app     ;# extend <b>my_app</b> instead of Applet
	set P(package) my_package ;# place the code in package <b>my_package</b>
	set P(export)  check      ;# add an class instance array with this property
	set P(other_items:entry) check  ;# add option <b>check</b> to all entry widgets
</pre>
SpecTcl allows application specific options to be added to widgets, which is
then passed through to the java code. <b>P(export)</b> contains a list
of option names, each of which causes a class instance variable of type
<code>String[]</code> to be generated that contains the the value of that
option for each widget.  Widgets that do not have that property are given
a string value of <code>null</code>. <b>P(otheritems:<i>widget_name</i>)</b>
contains a list of options that are added to the option sheet for the widget
<i>widget_name</i>.
generated.
<h2>Sample java generated code</h2>
This is a sample of the code generated for an interface with a single
button, <em>hello</em>, that prints the word "hello" when pressed:
<ul>
<pre>
// SpecTcl generated class hello, version 0.01

import java.awt.*;
public class hello extends java.applet.Applet {		

public Button button_1;

//methods to support form introspection
public static String names[] = {
	"button_1",
};
public String[] getNames() {
	return names;
}

//There should be an easier way to do this
public Object[] getWidgets() {
	Object[] list = new Object[1];
	list[0] = button_1;
	return list;
}

public void init() {

	// main panel
	GridBagLayout grid = new GridBagLayout();
	int rowHeights[] = {0,30};
	int columnWidths[] = {0,30};
	double rowWeights[] = {0.0,0.0};
	double columnWeights[] = {0.0,0.0};
	grid.rowHeights = rowHeights;
	grid.columnWidths = columnWidths;
	grid.rowWeights = rowWeights;
	grid.columnWeights = columnWeights;
	button_1 = new Button();
	button_1.setFont(new Font("Helvetica",Font.PLAIN + Font.BOLD , 16));
	button_1.setForeground(new Color(0/256,0/256,65535/256));
	button_1.setLabel("hello");
	this.add(button_1);

	// Geometry management
	GridBagConstraints con = new GridBagConstraints();
	reset(con);
	con.gridx = 1;
	con.gridy = 1;
	con.anchor = GridBagConstraints.CENTER;
	con.fill = GridBagConstraints.NONE;
	grid.setConstraints(button_1, con);


	// Resize behavior management and parent hierarchy
	setLayout(grid);

	// Give the application a chance to do its initialization
	super.init();
}

public boolean handleEvent(Event event) {
	if (event.target == button_1 && event.id == event.ACTION_EVENT) {
		System.out.println("hello");
	} else
		return super.handleEvent(event);
	return true;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Frame f = new Frame("hello Test");
    hello win = new hello();
    win.init();
    f.add("Center", win);
    f.pack();
    f.show();
}

private void reset(GridBagConstraints con) { ... } 
}
</pre>
</ul>

<h1>
SpecTcl User Interface</h1></center>

<center>
<h2>
Main window</h2></center>

<center><img SRC="l1.gif" height=501 width=762></center>

<p>This view of the SpecTcl user interface shows the location of the major
functional regions.
<dl>
<dt>
MenuBar</dt>

<dd>
Most of the capabilities of SpecTcl may be invoked from one of the menus
on the MenuBar. Many of those options have single-key <i>short cuts
</i>,
the key, or key combination that is listed to the right of the menu option.</dd>

<dt>
Tool-Bar</dt>

<dd>
Many of the common widget configuration options may be accessed via the
<a href="glossary.html#toolbar">tool-bar</a> as well as from the widget's
option sheet. When ever a widget is selected, the icon for each tool-bar
item will change to reflect the current state of its option for that widget.
The <a href="glossary.html#toolbar">tool-bar</a> items permit rapid configuration
of (from left to right>:</dd>

<ul compact>
<li>
The sides of the widget that stick to the enclosing cell</li>

<li>
How the text within a widget is justified (left, right, or center)</li>

<li>
The text style (plain, bold, italic, or both). The text style, unlike the
other <a href="glossary.html#toolbar">tool-bar</a> items, is not a menu.
repeatedly clicking on the <b>A</b> cycles through the various styles.</li>

<li>
The point size for the text in the widget</li>

<li>
The <tt>foreground</tt> color of the widget. This also sets the <tt>activeforeground</tt>
If the default color choices are not adequate, selecting <i>more...</i>
will pop up a dialog box to add an arbitrary color to the palette.</li>

<li>
The background color of the widget.</li>

<li>
The shape of the border relief (flat, raised, sunken, ridge, or groove)</li>

<li>
The border thickness</li>

<li>
The orientation, either <tt>horizontal</tt> or <tt>vertical</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<dt>
Widget Palette</dt>

<dd>
The widget palette contains an entry for each widget that SpecTcl discovered
during startup. Widgets are created by dragging them with the mouse from
the palette onto the <a href="glossary.html#canvas">canvas</a>, or by clicking
on a palette item to select it, and then clicking on empty grid cells to
create one of these widgets. Normally widgets are created with their Tk
defaults. Double-clicking on a palette item brings up a generic widget
option sheet, which can be used to alter the default properties that widgets
are created with.</dd>

<dt>
Row Handles</dt>

<dd>
The row handles are used to configure the minimum size and resize behavior
of a table row, as well as provide visual feedback while dragging a widget.
Each grid (or sub-grid) within the <a href="glossary.html#canvas">canvas</a>
has its own row handles. Only the handles for the current grid are displayed.
The following operations are valid on row handles:</dd>

<ul compact>
<li>
Clicking on a row handle selects it, causing it to turn&nbsp;<color value=red>red</color>.
Once a row handle is selected, its row may be deleted with the <tt>delete</tt>
key. A row is never deleted if it is occupied by a widget that would have
to be deleted in order to make the row go away.</li>

<li>
Once a row handle is selected, clicking on it toggles the resize behavior
of its row. The shape of the ends indicates its current resize behavior.</li>

<li>
Grabbing a handle with the mouse and dragging it causes its minimum size
to be changed. This will cause any widget in that row whose sticky property
is either <tt>n</tt> or <tt>s</tt> to grow or shrink accordingly. Currently,
the smallest size a row may shrink to is two pixels, or the height of the
largest widget in that row.</li>

<li>
When a row handle is selected, the corresponding row properties (-pad,
-minsize &amp; -weight) can be edited directly by selecting "Row &amp;
Column Properties..." from the "Edit" menu in the menubar (consult "grid
rowconfigure ..." in the Tcl/Tk manual for details).</li>

<p><br>Resizing rows that contain widgets that span multiple rows may appear
to have strange behavior, due to the way the resize constraints are maintained.
The Current height of the row (in pixels) is displayed in the <a href="#message">message
area</a> during the drag.</ul>

<dt>
Column Handles</dt>

<dd>
The column handles are used to configure the minimum size and resize behavior
of a table column, as well as provide visual feedback while dragging a
widget. Each grid (or sub-grid) within the <a href="glossary.html#canvas">canvas</a>
has its own column handles. Only the handles for the current grid are displayed.
The following operations are valid on column handles:</dd>

<ul compact>
<li>
Clicking on a column handle selects it, causing it to turn&nbsp;<color value=red>red</color>.
Once a column handle is selected, its column may be deleted with the <tt>delete</tt>
key. A column is never deleted if it is occupied by a widget that would
have to be deleted in order to make the column go away.</li>

<li>
Once a column handle is selected, clicking on it toggles the resize behavior
of its column. The shape of the ends indicates its current resize behavior.</li>

<li>
Grabbing a handle with the mouse and dragging it causes its minimum size
to be changed. This will cause any widget in that column whose sticky property
is either <tt>e</tt> or <tt>w</tt> to grow or shrink accordingly. Currently,
the smallest size a column may shrink to is two pixels, or the width of
the largest widget in that column.</li>

<li>
When a column handle is selected, the corresponding column properties (-pad,
-minsize &amp; -weight) can be edited directly by selecting "Row &amp;
Column Properties..." from the "Edit" menu in the menubar (consult "grid
columnconfigure ..." in the Tcl/Tk manual for details).</li>

<p><br>Resizing columns that contain widgets that span multiple column
may appear to have strange behavior, due to the way the resize constraints
are maintained. The Current height of the column (in pixels) is displayed
in the <a href="#message">message area</a> during the drag.</ul>

<dt>
Message area</dt>

<dd>
The&nbsp;<a NAME="message"></a>message area is used for a variety of things
in SpecTcl.</dd>

<ul compact>
<li>
If <b>help</b> is turned on (the default), anytime the mouse cursor stays
on a user interface element for more than a couple of seconds, a one line
description of that element is displayed in the message area.</li>

<li>
Warnings, progress messages and diagnostics are displayed in the message
area where appropriate.</li>

<li>
When dragging either a widget or a resize handle, the message area is used
to indicate the progress of the dragging operation</li>

<li>
When SpecTcl is busy, the message area turns&nbsp;<color value=red>red</color>.
Wait until the message changes to black before initiating any user interface
actions</li>
</ul>

<dt>
grid</dt>

<dd>
The grid demarcates the rows and column in which widgets are placed to
create the user interface. The grid lines divide the user interface into
<b>rows</b> and <b>columns</b>. The rectangular region created by the intersection
of a row and a column is called a <b>cell</b>. Each widget may occupy (exclusively)
a rectangular group of cells, which is called a <b>cavity</b>. Grid lines
never cross a cavity, and are <i>erased</i> where a cavity spans a row
or column boundary.</dd>

<p><br>The size of the grid may be increased or decreased as desired. New
rows or columns may be added by clicking on an existing grid line. Empty
rows or column may be deleted either by selecting the appropriate row or
column handle and keying <tt>delete</tt>, or by clicking on an empty cell
(which automatically selects the cell's row and column handles), then keying
<tt>delete</tt>.
<dt>
Canvas</dt>

<dd>
The <a href="glossary.html#canvas">canvas</a> is the semi-infinite area
in which the user interface or <b>panel</b> is built, and contains the
grid and the widgets of the user interface.</dd>

<dt>
scroll bars</dt>

<dd>
A user interface may be constructed which is larger than the currently
viewable area of the <a href="glossary.html#canvas">canvas</a>. The scrollbars
may be used to scroll the desired region of the <a href="glossary.html#canvas">canvas</a>
into view.</dd>

<p><br>When dragging a widget, the <a href="glossary.html#canvas">canvas</a>
view (and scrollbars) are automatically repositioned when the widget is
dragged to the edge of the <a href="glossary.html#canvas">canvas</a>'s
viewable region.
<dt>
project name</dt>

<dd>
The name of the current <b>project</b> or user interface panel is displayed
in the SpecTcl title bar, along with the version of SpecTcl being used.
The representation of the title bar is controlled by the window manager,
so the position and style of the title may differ from what is shown in
the picture.</dd>

<h2>
Selected widget</h2></center>

<center><img SRC="5a.gif" BORDER=3 height=437 width=663></center>

<p>A widget's properties can only be changed while the widget is <b>selected</b>
Only one widget may be selected at a time, either by <b>clicking</b> on
it with the mouse, or by using the arrow keys.
<p>The selected widget is always highlighted by a&nbsp;<color value=red>red
border&nbsp;</color>, called the selection highlight. (Note that when a
row or column handle is selected, it is also displayed in&nbsp;<color value=red>red</color>).
<p>In addition to being highlighted, the sides and corners of the selected
widget's cavity are decorated with <b>resize handles</b> that may be used
to change the number of cells that the cavity occupies. When the mouse
cursor is over a resize handle, the cursor shape changes to indicate the
direction (or directions) that the cavity may grow. The cavity may only
be expanded until it reaches the end of the grid, or abuts another cavity.
<p>When a widget is moved or copied (or pasted from the clipboard), its
cavity is changed to occupy a single cell, to make it more apparent where
it will go when it is dropped. There are three ways to change the selected
widgets properties:
<dl compact>
<dt>
The option sheet</dt>

<dd>
The option sheet is a scrollable list of key/value pairs that contains
every configuration property for a widget. It is accessed by keying <i>control-w</i>,
selection <i>widget options</i> from the menu, or by double-clicking on
the widget.</dd>

<dt>
The tool-bar</dt>

<dd>
The tool-bar allows configuring common widget properties quickly, without
resorting to the option sheet.</dd>

<dt>
By direct manipulation</dt>

<dd>
The row, column, row-span, and column-span may be adjusted directly, by
dragging the widget or its cavities resize handles.</dd>
</dl>

<center>
<hr></center>

<center>
<h2>
Option Sheet</h2></center>

<center><img SRC="option.gif" height=336 width=388>
<br>The widget's option sheet may be used to configure all of its properties.
Each property must be validated before the change is affected. Before validation,
the text for the option is shown in&nbsp;<color value=red>red</color>.
When the <b>dismiss</b> button is pressed, all non-validated values resort
to their last good value.</center>

<p>some of the widget's options are rarely used by applications, and are
deemed to be <i>additional</i>. By deselecting the <tt>additional</tt>
check-box at the bottom of the window, the <i>additional</i> options are
removed from the option sheet.

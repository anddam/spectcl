 -->canvas
<dd>The scrollable grid in the main window. The widgets are dragged
into <strong>cells</strong> of the grid.</a>  Not to be confused with
the 'canvas' widget. <a name=cell>
<dt>cell 
<dd>A cell is the intersection of a single row or column.</a> <a name=cavity>
<dt>cavity 
<dd>A cavity is one or more cells, in a rectangular region. Only one
widget may occupy a cavity, and unless the widget has been configured
to fill its cavity, much of it will appear empty. Grid lines will not
pass through a cavity, only around its edges.</a> <a name=column> 
<dt>column 
<dd>A column is the space between vertical grid lines. In the context
of a widget, its column represents the left most column in its cavity.
Columns are numbered starting at one (1).</a> <a name=column-span>
<dt>column-span 
<dd>A column-span is the number of columns occupied by a widget.</a>
<a name=option> 
<dt>option sheet 
<dd>Each widget has a list of name/value pairs that specify all the
needed to specify the properties of that widget. This list of name/value
pairs is called a property sheet, which is accessed by double-clicking
on the widget.</a> <a name=grid> 
<dt>grid 
<dd>The grid demarcates the set of rows and columns for the interface,
dividing it into cells into which widgets may be placed.</a> 
<dt>item_name 
<dd>This is the name the application uses to access a widget. If the
widget's procedure is instantiated by <code>project_ui $frame</code>,
then the full name of the widget is <code>$frame.<i>item_name</i></code>
<a name=palette> 
<dt>palette 
<dd>The palette is the column of buttons on the left side of the user
interface that indicated the widgets. Widgets are created by clicking
on a palette item, and dragging it onto the desired location on the
canvas.</a> <a name=panel> 
<dt>panel 
<dd>A panel consists of all the widgets created together on the canvas
at one time. Panels are saved as a single <code>ui</code> file, and
are instantiated by calling the panel's procedure with the name of
the frame (or toplevel) it is to be rendered in. A typical application
consists of one or more panels.</a> <a name=row> 
<dt>row 
<dd>A row is the space between horizontal grid lines. In the context
of a widget, its horizontal represents the top most column in its cavity.
Rows are numbered starting at one (1).</a> <a name=row-span> 
<dt>row-span 
<dd>A Row-span is the number of rows occupied by a widget.</a> <a name=tool-bar>
<dt>tool-bar 
<dd>The tool-bar is the row of icons and menus along the top of the
user interface, just under the menu bar, that provides a short cut
for setting common properties for the selected widget.</a> <a name=sub-grid>
<dt>sub-grid 
<dd>A sub-grid is a table of rows and columns that occupies a cavity
either in the main grid, or in another sub-grid. Sub-grids, which are
created by dragging <em>frames</em> onto the existing grid, are used
when the programmer needs to give some widgets a different resize behavior.</a>
<a name=widget> 
<dt>widget 
<dd>A widget is an atomic user interface element, such as a <em>button</em>
or <em>scrollbar</em>. All of the available widgets are presented on
the palette.</a>

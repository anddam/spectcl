<p>
Since this dialog box has three buttons on the bottom, but two labels
on top, the widgets don't align properly into columns. Three columns
for the buttons would be one too many for the labels, and 2 columns
for the labels would be too few for the buttons. 
<p>
This dilemma is solved by inserting a sub-grid, or frame in the top
row. Sub-grids allow rectangular regions of the grid to have different
row and/or column boundaries.

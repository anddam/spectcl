 -->Interfacing
the Application with the User Interface</h1>
<h2>Generated code and naming conventions</h2>
<p>
All of the code that describes the layout for a user interface panel
is contained in a single procedure. If the panel is named <tt>panel</tt>,
then the procedure <tt>panel_ui</tt> will be created, and stored in
a file called <tt>panel.ui.tcl</tt>. 
<p>
To instantiate the user interface, the application program needs to
<tt>source</tt> the code in <tt>panel.ui.tcl</tt> and call <tt>panel_ui</tt>
with a single argument, the name of a frame or toplevel that the panel's
widgets will be instantiated in. This frame or toplevel should already
be created by the application. 
<p>
The names of the widget commands are the window path of the container
frame plus the <tt>item_name</tt> option for that widget. All of the
widgets in a panel are <i>siblings</i> in the Tk widget hierarchy,
no matter what grid or sub-grid the widget is placed in for layout
purposes. So, for a button with an item name of 'foo', in an interface
put into the frame '.bar', the widget name is '.bar.foo'. 
<p>
The widget <i>command</i> option field is used to call out from the
widget to the application code. The special <i>escape</i> sequences:
%R, %B, %W, and %M can be used when entering the text for any <a HREF="options.html#command">command
option</a> to refer to the fully resolved names of the widgets, even
though the frame it is instantiated in may not be known in advance.


<h2>An example application</h2>
<p>
Suppose we created a sample application, called <i>example</i> that
consists of a single button, whose <tt>item_name</tt> is <i>button#1</i>
(the default name), and whose command option is: 
<pre>        puts "Hello, I'm %W"
</pre>
<p>
. The code generated by SpecTcl will be in <tt>example.ui.tcl</tt>
and look like: 
<pre><ul># interface generated by SpecTcl version 1.0 from untitled.ui 
# root is the parent window for this user interface proc untitled_ui {root args}
{ 
# this treats "." as a special case
if {$root == "."} {
  set base ""
} else {
  set base $root
}

button $base.button#1 \
  -command "puts \
   "Hello, I'm $base.button#1 "" \
    -padx 9 \
    -pady 3 \
    -text hello
# Geometry management
grid $base.button#1 -in $root -row 1 -column 1 \
   -sticky {}
# Resize behavior management
grid rowconfigure $root 1 -weight 0.0 -minsize 30
grid rowconfigure $root 2 -weight 0.0 -minsize 30
grid columnconfigure $root 1 -weight 0.0 -minsize 30
grid columnconfigure $root 2 -weight 0.0 -minsize 30
# additional interface code
# end additional interface code
}
</ul></pre>
<p>
Notice that the text of the <tt>command</tt> option is grouped with
(")'s, which is required to expand the variable <tt>$base</tt> which
was part of the substitution for <tt>%W</tt>. In this case, the internal
(")'s are appropriately protected. 
<p>
When SpecTcl tests the application, it will look to see if the file
<tt>example.tcl</tt> exists. If the file does <u>not</u> exist, The
follow program is written and run: 
<pre><ul>tk appname test_example
wm title . "SpecTcl - example"
source /home/user/project/example.ui.tcl example_ui .
</ul></pre>
<p>
If <tt>example.tcl</tt> <u>does</u> exist, then SpecTcl will try to
run: 
<pre><ul>tk appname test_example
wm title . "SpecTcl - example"
source /home/user/project/example.ui.tcl
source /home/user/project/example.tcl
</ul></pre>
<p>
In this case, the code in <tt>example.tcl</tt> needs to instantiate
the interface by sourcing <tt>example.ui.tcl</tt> and then calling
<tt>example_ui</tt>.

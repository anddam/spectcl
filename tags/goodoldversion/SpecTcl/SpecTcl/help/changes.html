<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>SpecTcl Change file</H1>

<H1>Major Changes from 0.3 -&gt; 1.0</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Internal support for multi-platform code was added. Now behaves like
a real Mac application on the Mac.</LI>

<LI>3D Preferences </LI>

<LI>Java compilation results are returned in a text window.</LI>

<LI>Icons added</LI>

<LI>Command buttons have been added to the toolbar, so that it's easy to
get to 4 common functions: insert, delete, Build&amp;test, Kill test. </LI>

<LI>Clicking on a gridline now selects it. Pressing 'insert' or 'delete'
now has the appropriate action. There's currently no way to insert or delete
without selecting something first. </LI>

<LI>The option sheets are now tabbed dialogs, with 3 buttons near the bottom
of the dialog. The &quot;Okay&quot; button posts changes, saves changes
in the .SpecTclrc file, and closes the form. The &quot;Apply&quot; button
simply posts the changes. The &quot;Cancel&quot; button gets rid of the
form with no changes. </LI>

<LI>Copying of frames and subframes works now. </LI>

<LI>The arrows and interface have gone through internal changes so that
they are much faster, and more interactive. </LI>

<LI>File selection dialogs and color dialogs are more intuitive. </LI>

<LI>SpecTcl internally uses grid now, and as such runs with Wish 4.1 or
greater with no modification to the core. </LI>

<LI>Text styles are now a menu instead of a button. </LI>

<LI>Menus now have balloon help. </LI>
</UL>

<H1>Major Changes from 0.2 -&gt; 0.3</H1>

<UL>
<LI>The <B><TT>java.project</TT></B> file is gone. The equivalent information
is now stored in the user interface file. Arbitrary tcl code can be sourced
to modify <B>SpecTcl</B> on a per-project basis by placing it in placed
in a <I>project</I>.rc file in the current directory. </LI>

<LI>Application extensions to SpecTcl are added via command line flags.
Java mode is invoked via <B>-java</B> on the command line. This causes
the file <TT>java_init.tk</TT> to be sourced. In general, the command line
flag <B>-foo</B> will cause SpecTcl to source the file <B><TT><I>foo</I>_init.tk</TT></B>.
</LI>

<LI>With this release, the <B>SpecJava</B> interface files have the suffix
<B>.jui</B>, not <B>.ui</B>. It is no longer possible to generate both
TCL and JAVA apps from the identical <I>ui</I> file. This never worked
quite right anyway. </LI>

<LI>The Tk version of SpecTcl can now produce output compatible with the
<B>grid</B> geometry manager, by specifying <B><TT>-grid</TT></B> on the
command line. </LI>
</UL>

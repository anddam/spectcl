<p>
We now have all the items we need. If the label above isn't selected,
click on it to select it. Type the phrase 'Are you sure?'. Also note
that the resize behavior isn't correct for the frame right now.  The
left column of the subframe is set to grow, and the right column isn't.
 Click on each column heading, until the left column heading doesn't
have outward pointing arrows, and the right column does.
